= NixOS Artifacts
:page-role: index

Welcome to the minimal documentation site for the NixOS Artifacts project.

This site is built with Antora and is intentionally small; the primary goal is to demonstrate the Nix dev shell setup and file structure for building Antora documentation suitable for GitHub Pages.

== Getting Started

- Build the site with the flake app: `nix run .#build-docs`.
- The generated site will be in docs/public.
