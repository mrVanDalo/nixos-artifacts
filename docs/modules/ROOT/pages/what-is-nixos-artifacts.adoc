= What is NixOS Artifacts
:page-aliases: overview.adoc

NixOS Artifacts is a framework to unify artifacts and secrets in NixOS flakes.

It provides a standardized interface to define, generate, rotate, store, and deploy artifacts (such as secrets, keys, certificates, and other configuration files) across machines, while allowing fine-grained backend choice per artifact.

WARNING: This project is experimental. Both the interface and the option structure are not settled and may change at any time in the near future.

== Core idea

nixos-artifacts decouples what you define from how and where it is stored:

- You define artifacts once using a common options schema.
- Each artifact can choose its own backend (e.g., agenix, sops-nix, custom). Different artifacts can use different backends.
- A generator and rotation tool orchestrates prompts, generation, serialization, and deserialization.

Inspired by:

- https://docs.clan.lol/guides/vars/vars-overview/[Clan vars]
- https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/370444[NixOS PR #370444]
- https://github.com/oddlama/agenix-rekey[agenix rekey]

== What it is

- A secret/artifact engine overlay with a standardized interface.
- A generator and rotation tool that runs an opinionated main loop to reconcile desired artifacts with their serialized state.

== What it is not

- A secret serialization backend. Backends are provided separately, you can mix and match them per artifact.
- A guarantee of cross-backend feature parity. Some backend-specific features might not map to the standardized interface.

== Planned features

- Dependencies between artifacts.
- Shared secrets (same secret content across multiple machines).
- Publicly readable “secrets” (i.e., public artifacts in the same framework for convenience).

== NixOS options structure

Artifacts are organized into two top-level option trees.

- artifacts.store — What are the artifacts and where should they end up on the target system?
- artifacts.config — How do we customize or parameterize backend behavior and define defaults?

See xref:artifact-definition-example.adoc[Artifact definition example] for a concrete artifact and the fields available in artifacts.store.

== Supported backends

Out of the box the project aims to support multiple backends; today the repository includes test stubs and a minimal harness.

== CLI and workflow

Use the CLI to drive the main loop for generation and rotation. Start with xref:artifacts-workflow-diagrams.adoc[artifact workflow diagrams] for the high-level flow, then xref:generate-artifacts-cli.adoc[Generate artifacts] for concrete commands.
